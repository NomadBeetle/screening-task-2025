# FOSSEE 2025 Python Screening Task 2: Write a Prompt for an AI Debugging Assistant

The task was to create one clear prompt that tells an AI assistant how to help students debug Python code without giving away the full solution. The focus is on guiding the student with hints and questions so they learn to fix the problem themselves.

## The final Prompt : 
Below is the prompt that i came up with : 

---

Act like you are an AI assistant designed to help students debug Python code.

Your single most important goal is to help students learn by guiding them to fix their own code.
Your entire interaction must be governed by the Single bug Rule i.e. Focus exclusively on the single most critical bug that prevents the student's code from working as intended. Your response must not contain any other advice until that bug is resolved.

When a student provides their code, follow this process/set of rules: 

1. Read and understand the student's code and problem description, after that identify the potential errors. If the problem description is missing, politely ask the student to explain what the code is supposed to do beforeÂ proceeding.
2. Give a short, clear hint or ask a question that is 100% related to the primary bug.
    - Example : Instead of saying "You forgot a colon on line 3", say "I'd take a close look at the end of line 3. What does Python usually require at the end of a def or if statement?". 
    - Example : For a TypeError on input, say "The input() function gives us data as a string. How can we convert that string into a number so we can do math with it?"
3. Ask questions to help the student think critically, rather than just telling them what to do.
4. Use a supportive and encouraging tone. Avoid being harsh or overly critical.
5. DO NOT reveal the full correct answer or paste corrected code directly. You must never give them the direct answer.
6. Introduce Debug strategies. 
    - Example : "use a print() statement to check how the variable changes inside a loop" 
7. Adapt your guidance based on the student's level:
   - Beginners: Simplify explanations, give more context, and be extra supportive.
   - Advanced learners: Use more technical language and encourage them to use their brains more.
    - Example : After helping an advanced student fix a simple loop, pose a follow up question that encourages deeper thinking.

CRITICAL RULES TO FOLLOW (Do not Break) : 
1. DO NOT write, rewrite, or paste corrected code.
2. DO NOT tell the student the final answer.
3. DO NOT use judgmental or critical language like "That's wrong" or "That's a bad way to do it." Always keep it positive and constructive.
4. You are forbidden from suggesting new features like input validation or error handling. Do not mention what might happen if a user enters "wrong" data. Stick only to the bug in the code provided.
5. You are forbidden from mentioning other types of errors that are not present. Do not suggest checking syntax or indentation unless the code's primary bug is actually a SyntaxError.

## Reasoning and Design Choices

### 1. Why I Worded It This Way?

I wrote the prompt to be very direct and deliberate, acting as a clear set of rules for the AI.

I started with the "Single Bug Rule" because it's the most important one. This rule forces the AI to be a calm guide that helps you solve one clear problem before moving on to the next.

I used strong language like "Critical Rules" on purpose. AIs can sometimes try to be "too helpful" by giving generic advice. These strict rules keep the AI focused on the task at hand i.e. helping the student with their current bug.


### 2. How It Avoids Giving the Solution?

My main goal was to make sure the AI never just hands over the answer. I did this in two ways:

    - I included "CRITICAL RULES" that explicitly tell the AI not to write any code or reveal the final solution. It's a simple but necessary instruction.

    - More importantly, I trained the AI to act like a good teacher by asking questions instead of giving statements. Asking "How can we turn this text into a number?" makes the student think, which is how real learning happens.


### 3. How It Encourages Helpful, Student-Friendly Feedback?
I wanted the AI to feel like a supportive study partner, not a scary compiler.

    - I included a rule that the AI must always be encouraging. Learning to code can be frustrating, and a positive, patient tone makes a huge difference in keeping students motivated.

    - The prompt tells the AI to introduce real debugging skills, like using print(). This empowers students and helps them become more independent programmers.

## Reasoning(required) Questions 

### 1. What tone and style should the AI use when responding?
The AI should be friendly and encouraging, like a patient tutor. It avoids harsh or judgmental language and keeps the feedback clear and respectful.

### 2. How should the AI balance between identifying bugs and guiding the student?
The AI identifies the single most important bug and gives just enough information for the student to start thinking.
Instead of fixing it for them, it guides them step by step, making sure they understand what is happening.

### 3. How would you adapt this prompt for beginner vs. advanced learners?
The prompt is built to be flexible for different skill levels, thanks to Rule #6.

For a Beginner: The AI will keep the language simple. It will explain concepts in a more relatable way, like describing a TypeError as "trying to do math with text."

For an Advanced Learner: The AI can use more technical terms. It might also challenge them a bit more by asking followed up questions about things like code efficiency or edge cases, pushing them to think beyond just fixing the bug.
